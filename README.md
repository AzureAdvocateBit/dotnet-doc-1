# dotnet-doc

Start of the tooling for `dotnet doc`. Allows for using the command to search http://docs.microsoft.com for a keyword or phrase and return the relevant content.

Currently will launch default browser showing results of the search. When global commands in the dotnet cli return, this will be converted to such.
